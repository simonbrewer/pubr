## Mapping UK pub names

This is an attempt to map UK pub names as kernel surfaces, which will allow population and pub density adjustments. 

The code was obtained using scripts and data by Jovan Lekovicj at 

https://github.com/lekovicj/Geography-of-Pub-Names

and 

http://constantlyplotting.com/the-geography-of-uk-pub-names/

## Basic exploration

```{r}
pubs <- read.csv("./data/osmPubs.csv")
head(pubs)
```
